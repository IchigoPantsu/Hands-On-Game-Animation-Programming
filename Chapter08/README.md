# Chapter 8

This chapter is all about curves, specifically how animation curves can be organized into animation clips. You will learn how to implement a curve, with different interpolation methods, how to generalize curves into tracks and how to generalize tracks into animation clips. The sample in ```Sample01``` visualizes several curves.
