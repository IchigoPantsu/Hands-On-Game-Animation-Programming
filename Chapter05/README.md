# Chapter 5

In the last three chapters you learned about vectors, matrices and quaternions. In this chapter you will learn how to encode [transformation data](https://gabormakesgames.com/transforms.html) using vectors and quaternions into a ```Transform``` class. A ```Transform``` can be converted to a ```mat4``` to be used in shaders.
