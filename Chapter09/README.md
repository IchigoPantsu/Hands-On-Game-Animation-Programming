# Chapter 9

In this chapter you will learn about animation hierarchies (skeletons) and how to use them to capture a specific time of an aniation clip into a pose. By the end of this chapter you will have a functional skeletal animation system, even if there is no skinning yet. The sample in ```Sample01``` draws lines to show the animated pose.
