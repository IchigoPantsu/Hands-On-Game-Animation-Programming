# Chapter 10

In this chapter you will learn how to load meshes from GLTF files and how to deform those meshes to a pose. Deforming meshes to fit a pose is called skinning, by the end of this chapter you will be able to implement both CPU and GPU skinning. ```Sample01``` displays the rest pose, bind pose and current animated pose at the same time (without any skinned meshes). ```Sample02```  shows both CPU and GPU skinned animation.
